## Available Scripts from a web app to Android mobile app

### step 1: ionic build

Build web assets and prepare your app for any platform targets. After this command, a "www" folder would be created for future capacitor configuration.

### step 2: ionic capacitor add android

Add Android platform specific folder to our project.

### step 3: ionic capacitor run android

Through this command, the project would automatically do the following things: <br />
i. Perform ionic build (or run the dev server from ionic serve with the --livereload option) <br />
ii. Copy web assets into the specified native platform <br />
iii. Open the IDE for this project (Android Studio for Android) <br />

### step 4: setup android studio with correct JDK and simulators

After these, the Android app should be run successfully if Android Studio is set up previously. <br />
